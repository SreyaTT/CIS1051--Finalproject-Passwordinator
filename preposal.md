# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have two ideas on what I'd like to build:
1) My first idea is Connect four, with a two-player variant and a game mode that plays against a computer. I'm hoping to implement special tokens that clear out tokens in the row when put down.
2) My second idea is to build an app that keeps track of free throws and keeps averages of them. It would have a real world application as my boyfriend and I currently use mobile excel (which is messy and hard to use) to track our averages.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan on working alone. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I don't have any questions currently.
