# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Password Protector 3000

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A password protector that stores passwords and usernames, and helps generate new ones. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will have a menu that allows users to either, retrieve a password for an account, store a new login for an account, or generate a new secure password for an account. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A great outcome will be to get an SQL server set up and have python writing into it so that way I can easily access the accounts. I'll also make sure to get a menu created so that way it has a decent interface and is easy to use. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to be able to create secure passwords, which will require some research. I would love to create a password from a key that I know and hash it into a secure password. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Another idea that I had, if I have time, is to include a column in the SQL server that stores the subscription status of different accounts, and everytime you log into the password manager it tells you what subscriptions are coming up. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I needed to figure out how to connect a SQL server and Python. 
Next, I needed to learn how to communicate with the server with my python program.
Then, I needed to create a menu that communicates with the functions I previously wrote. 
Finally, I need to research how to hash a password and what methods make them most secure. I can't use this feasibly if it makes insecure passwords!
