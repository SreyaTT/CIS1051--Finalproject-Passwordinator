# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Chaotic Connect 4

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It's a game of connect four, but with an element of randomness. I would like that to include tokens for each team that clear columns or rows when played. If I have the time, I would like to include a token that forces the other team to aim where their token will be thrown. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will run a visual board and a visual for each team that displays which special tokens they still have remaining. It will include a computer run game and a two player mode. I 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish connect four, having a display and having a working rendition of the game for two players. I will be able to implement the tokens that clear lines of the board. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is to be able to implement a working computer player that isn't too easy to win against or too challenging. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be to implement the token that makes it harder for your opponent to aim. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I'll need to continue on the track to determine the best way to set up my board. I'll need to establish how to differentiate between tokens and give players the option to choose when to use their special tokens. If I hope to include the skill based token that forces a player to time/ aim their token, that will be another challenge I will have to overcome.
