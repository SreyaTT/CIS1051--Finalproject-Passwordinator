Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My plan changed, which I have discussed with Prof. Rosen. It is now a password manager that utilizes SQL and generates passwords given a secret key word. 
So far...
  I have successfully:
    1) Created an SQL server that stores the necessary data
    2) gotten python to interact with my SQL server, and rewrite into the database.
    3) created a function that recieves existing passwords from the database.
    4) created a function that inputs new logins to the database.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

So far...
  I have yet to:
    1) try to create a way to generate new passwords through hashing.
    2) create a (more) efficient menu to navigate through prompts. 
  
 
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
I've been studying SQL to try and utilize it properly and develop my skills with it. Setting up SQL itself has not been the challenge. Rather, the challenge was getting python connected to SQL and was probably the most difficult portion of the assignment so far. 
The next challenge I am facing is hashing passwords, I would have liked to been further along at this point but I think I should still be able to work this out by the due date.
